    <!-- LocalStorage vs SectionStorage -->
    <section>
        <h1>LocasStorage Vs SectionStorage</h1>
        <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that <strong> while data in localStorage
                doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. </strong> Whenever a
            document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to
            that particular tab.</p>

        <h1>JavaScript Event loop</h1>
        <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code,
            collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models
            in other languages like C and Java.</p>
